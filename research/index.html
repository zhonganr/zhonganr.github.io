Unraveling Temperature-Induced Vacancy Clustering in Tungsten: from Direct Microscopy to Atomistic Insights via Data-Driven Bayesian Sampling
Abstract: The evolution of the microstructure of materials is primarily governed by defect-mediated diffusion. Here, we examine the intriguing role played by vacancies in tungsten, a strategic metal for high-temperature fusion energy systems. We address the existing apparent contradictions between experimental observations indicating the presence of voids and theoretical predictions of vacancy self-repulsion by employing both experimental and theoretical methods. We designed a transmission electron microscopy experiment and developed a theoretical data-driven approach using the Bayesian adaptive biasing force method to investigate the finite temperature properties of mono- and di-vacancies and characterize their relative stability via their formation free energies. Our investigation reveals that di-vacancies are energetically unfavorable at low temperatures but stabilize entropically as the temperature increases. This result is entirely consistent with experimental observations of the clustering of quenched-in vacancies in tungsten during re-annealing treatments at intermediate temperatures. This work provides critical insights into the temperature-dependent stability of defects, bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, with significant implications for the design and optimization of high-temperature materials for fusion.">

Abstract: The theoretical investigation of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) from 0 K to melting temperature is proposed through a workflow combining density functional theory (DFT), Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and machine learning (ML). This workflow provides accurate predictions for HEA phases and offers a breakthrough in characterizing defects in HEAs. This study enables the incorporation of anharmonic vibrational free energy, for the first time, in the understanding of point defects in HEAs, providing a crucial tool for understanding the complex energy landscape of HEAs. The chosen HEA is Ta-Ti-V-W, for which thousands of DFT calculations over a wide range of compositions were conducted to design a reliable machine-learning force field. Predicted properties such as lattice parameters, elastic constants, distributions of formation energies of vacancy and interstitial defects, and anharmonic free energy of mono-vacancy formation have been discussed. This paper opens the way for systematic investigation of high-temperature HEA properties with DFT accuracy.</p>

The elastic properties of tungsten, a ubiquitous material in future energy systems, are investigated up to its melting temperature by means of a data-driven approach. The proposed workflow combines machine learning of the force field and enhanced sampling of the crystalline structure. While the machine learning force field achieves the accuracy of <em>ab initio</em> calculations, its implementation in sampling methods is often limited due to its high computational cost, which is commonly a few orders of magnitude larger than that of traditional potentials. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fast and robust Bayesian sampling scheme aiming at estimating the fully anharmonic free energy of crystalline solids with the help of an improved adaptive biasing force method. This method performs a thermodynamic integration from a harmonic reference system, wherein zero frequencies associated with the periodic boundaries are screened off. The proposed sampling method drastically improves the speed of convergence and overall accuracy. We demonstrate the efficiency of the improved method by calculating the second order derivatives of the free energy, such as the elastic constants, which are performed almost 100 times faster than with the standard methods. The proposed method enables the prediction of the elastic properties of tungsten in the range of temperatures that cannot be investigated experimentally, from 2100 K to the melting temperature. The accuracy and numerical efficiency of the proposed strategy open up many avenues for the reliable prediction of finite-temperature properties of materials, such as the relative stability of structural defects and elastic constants.</p>

A magnetic skyrmion is topologically protected because it possesses a non-zero topological charge. As a result, the creation or annihilation of a magnetic skyrmion is thought to be initiated by a sudden reversal of local magnetization, and thus cannot occur continuously. Here, we show that this viewpoint is only partially correct by studying the creation and annihilation of an isolated skyrmion in a nanodisk suffering coupled magnetic field and mechanical torsion. It was found that at a proper magnetic field, the torsion-induced chiral stress field can change the helicity of the magnetization structure and create or annihilate isolated skyrmion in a continuous way. In the torsion-magnetic-field phase diagram, there appears a critical point, where the type of the topological transition changes from a discontinuous to a continuous one. It was further proved that the critical condition for the continuous transition is the softness of magnetization at the center.</p>
<p><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ac3a82"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Dynamics and stability of skyrmions in a bent nano-beam</strong></a>
Magnetic skyrmions are attracting much attention due to their nontrivial topology and high mobility to electric current. Nevertheless, suppression of the skyrmion Hall effect and maintaining high velocity of skyrmions with low energy cost are two major challenges concerning skyrmion-based spintronic devices. Here we show theoretically that in a nano-beam suffering appropriate bending moment, both Bloch-type and NÃ©el-type skyrmions move with a vanishing Hall angle under a current density smaller than that required when the bending is absent. Moreover, bending alone can be used to move skyrmions, whose velocity is solved analytically from the Thiele equation. Generally speaking, inhomogeneous elastic fields affect the stability and dynamics of skyrmions, where the local stability is dominantly determined by the local bulk stress. These findings throw new light on how to drive skyrmions in a straight line with lower energy cost, which is vital for utilizing skyrmions as information carriers.</p>
